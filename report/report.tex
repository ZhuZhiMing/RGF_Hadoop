\section{Overview }

\begin{flushleft}
The Regularized Greedy Forest (RGF)\cite{1} is a new decision tree(forest)
method proposed in 2011, which works well in some cases and better
than some well-knowm methods such as, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted
Decision Tree. Our project is to make the trainning process parallel
and scalable by Allreduce\cite{2} on Hadoop.
